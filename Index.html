            <h1>Welcome to The Garden Shop</h1>
            <p>The garden shop, founded and operated by the Gaynor family, has been in operation for almost 40 years.
               The Gaynor family was born in Mullingar, in the midlands of Westmeath, where Peter grew up, married Aine, had a son named Paul, and two years later welcomed James, the family's youngest member.
               Peter inaugurated the shop on March 8, 1972, and since then, he has been teaching his sons Paul and James his values and knowledge.
               This sons are then teaching the same values and principles to Peter's grandchildren, Alana, Ela, Shaun, and Phillip.</p>
